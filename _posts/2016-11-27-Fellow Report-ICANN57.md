## How to read my read my report

I made this report  in 3 sections. The section "Before Fellow" explains some of the things that i was doing in the
internet governance field before the selection to the fellowship program. The section "During the meeting" will be a
overflight from my schedule and experiences during my first time fellow in Hyderabad. And the last section "Foellow Up" 
contains the activities that i intend to execute after the meeting.

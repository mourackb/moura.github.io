title: Fellow Report ICANN 57
---

## How to read my read my report

I made this report  in 3 sections. The section "Before Fellow" explains some of the things that i was doing in the
internet governance field before the selection to the fellowship program. The section "During the meeting" will be a
overflight from my schedule and experiences during my first time fellow in Hyderabad. And the last section "Foellow Up" 
contains the activities that i intend to execute after the meeting.

## Before Fellow

The day that i discovered the list of fellows in the Icann57 Fellowship program was such a special day. Since my participation in Icann53 in Buenos Aires as a nextgen@ICANN member i started a no way back journey through Internet Governance and all the eco system created to keep the internet open,resilient and accessible. This journey does not make sense if i did not talk about how important the NextGen was in my life (for this part Daniel Fink, Jeff Dunn and Lauren Alison have my gratitude as first sparklers in this area for me) After the amazing experience as a Nextgen member i start to ask myself what are my next steps. An important landmark in this journey is, in the newcomers session, receive the impact of the energy from Janice. What made my participation as NextGen member possible was a project that i developed with the support of Axur that aims to teach kids about how the internet works, their risks and how to protect themself and have fun. After return home i started to organize a remote hub for the Icann54 in Dublin, the idea was to invite the local community to participate in some sessions and explain what was the job of ICANN and how people can engage in the different layers.

Unfortunately, the days before the Remote Hub was one of the more strong rainfall that year (the city was flooded) and lot of people cannot make to the remote hub session due the flood problems. However this will not make me surrender to have a important role in the Internet Governance field.

Was invited by the CGI.BR (brazilian internet steering committee) to work as a volunteer in the IGF2015 that was held in Jo√£o Pessoa, Brazil. My job was to help coordination of remote participation moderators. During the IGF was possible to see lots a friends that i make in the Icann53 and even an informal  nextGen53 lunch was organized to get together everyone that was present at IGF due different circumstances. It was an important moment to see all the different possibilities that a young person can trail to find himself and find the best way to contribute.

My next challenge, the NextGen Ambassador at Icann55 held in Marrakech. As long this program have a special place in my heart, the possibility to engage more young people and introduce they to networking was something very special for me. I see this participation as a challenge for me, i created great expectations with myself and i want to fill they all (trying to not get on the thought that create expectation is a schedule our frustration). One important point in this meeting was the opportunity to know in person Jeannie, while i was working in the Icann information booth the wonder woman in the Oasis of Internet Governance.

I also participate at South School of Internet Governance in Washington, US. This participation was important for me to understand and mak networking with different people from Latin America and people from America. Was a moment to understand the role and get know the opportunities that institutions as OAS give to people. Mainly in the cybersecurity field, i believe that this one is my main field of work. But is not the only one. The SSIG was also important to talk more with Renata Aquino.

With the initiative of a nextgen53 allumi, Mark Datysgeld, invited to talk about cybersecurity in a project called Governance Prime, the idea is to teach and introduce people from different sectors about how Internet Governance works. The Sao Paulo edition really get my attention, so i started to discuss with Daniel Fink the possibility to host a Governance Prime edition in my city , Porto Alegre. This edition was only possible due the support of ICANN and the UNISINOS (my alma mater). The timing was excellent, we planned the event for june and on July the CGI.br would held in the same city the Brazilian Internet Forum (IGF Brazil). At same time that we are getting together people from different areas to discuss and engage Internet Governance, we are broadcasting the Forum and the possibility to get more people participating in the debates.

After receive the great notice  i start to plan my participation, this is such a singular opportunity and i want to grab this with energy, dedication and focus. With this in mind, i started to talk with different people who already take part in the Fellowship program. Asked about: What not to miss, tips to manage energy, how it works and what to avoids. 

This was very important for me, i understand that be NextGen member and be a Fellow is very different. This difference will make the process unique again, and this was exciting for me.

A few months before the start of Icann57 meeting i discover that Renata Aquino would be my coach in the Fellow. Such an honor (and maybe a bit of luck) to get in touch with someone who seems to understand and is so didactic to explain about our main struggles. Having Renata as a coach was almost as a Yoda-Luke relationship. The good part is that we are from different Brazil's i am from south and she is from northeast, completely different Brazil but at same time is the same Brazil. Looks confusing and it is, even from someone who is born and raise here

## During the Meeting

### Day 1

My first day at conference was a good to see again some amazing people who i have had contact in other editions of ICANN. During the morning i attended to the "Community Onboarding session - Pilot". It was interesting to see that each constituency has his own way of onboarding and this reflects the works, proccedings and even achievements from each one. There is a lot of work to be done here, maybe with more transparency of this pilot, people who are starting his journey on ICANN will feel better at onboarding process.  For example, we can't think the onboarding process similar to the airlines (it looks that we always are losing our time), the goal is different. The onboarding process must be an invite to join the community, explaining what the community is and what is does, allowing the newcomer to explore the relationships with other communities and institutions. One thing that wasn't clear for me was about the selection proccess of mentors and mentee. They have time to prepare they presentations? I saw more than one constituency preparing the presentation 5 minutes before the meeting started, i tried to find this info but maybe my search terms was wrong - this is something to look forward to better understand and cooperate. At the same time i understand that this is a Pilot, but would be great (and challenging) to create a benchmark about how joinable a constituency is.

During the lunch i meet with Raphael Silveiras, he was NExtGen@ICANN with me at Buenos Aires, he introduced some students from Afghanistan that are participating at InSIG( Indian School of Governance). I asked about then about the major features of the InSIG and what highlights they want to share with me.

In the afternoon i attend to "How it Works" sessions, i'm always delighted and always learning with tech team of ICANN about outreaching. They know how to do this in a marvelous way, as a technical person i'm always learning and training to explain complex and deep things  related to technical aspects to everyone. This is something that i see myself doing and is somethings that i'll seek for in my next steps. The first workshops was  "How it works: Introduction to Registry Operations Workshop (ROW) topics". They explain about the new coming tools that will try to replace the WHOIS tools. The RDAP (Registration Data Access Protocol) that will serve to IP address and name. The main advantage that i see is the EPP (Extensible Provisioning Protocol) that can show different information based on the access contacts restrictions. The community also see great advantage in the RESTfull property of this tool.

The second workshop from my afternoon was "How it works: Root Server Operations", where we can understand the evolution of DNS and how they became the 13 unique identifiers. The discussion between "Unicast versus Anycast" was very interesting to see the debate on Centralized versus Distributed.

### Day 2

The second day started with the Meet and Greet of Fellows, coaches fellows, Nextgens and Onboarding mentors and mentee. And it was fantastic! Get know every member from programs, it is good to take note from someone who has convergence with our intentions, or belongs from a community that i have interest into. During the Newcomer day its possible to have a shallow idea about all the ICANN's work. I really enjoyed the idea of not say acronyms, i think it helps a lot the newcomers. Most of participants are different from my first newcomer session in Buenos Aires. However, in Hyderabad some talk are very slowly and with the jet lag kicking me from inside was a struggle to get in.

I also attend tothe  presentation from the CertIn and it was very interesting to see the same process  and problems with mitigation of threats in India and in Brazil. Maybe they should create a CertBRICS to develop cooperation between the BRICS countries, because they see to face the same problems. 

During the lunch, we have our first presencial meeting form our team, we call it the Team JPL (DUe the name member James, Pilar and Lucas) it was good to better know my team members. Renata is a great coach and do an amazing job to get the team together always. She care about introduce us to different people from different areas.

After a overflight thru the ICANN valley, i've watched the "DNSSec for Beginners session" it is fun and at same time is very didactic. Explaining why should ask our DNS providers about DNSSec. 

We can finish the day in a reception in the outdoors of the conference center. During this reception i talked a lot with the fellows Thato were he explained to me his work in South Africa connecting the community as a entrepreneur role.

###		Day 3

After wake up, i have had a meeting with my couch Renata Aquino to discuss my agenda, she also explains me how the Working groups are created, we've talked also about the great number of Closed Meetings in this edition and sometimes when we ask to the session organizers about this issue they explain that they chose to made a closed session due the lack of space in the room, this is not the best reason to made a closed session.

The opening ceremony was marked by Trump's jokes (at the end of meeting we discover he was elected in USA). The huge numbers of India digital inclusion was presented, a good part of the next billion are in India and some ICANN works (i.e. the newGTLD with Internalization) will help more people have access (and consume) internet resources.


<img src="images/IMG_3146.JPG" alt="hi" class="inline"/>

After the opening ceremony went to meeting with NextGen ambassadors to share some ideas about the Ambassador work and activities with the NextGens@ICANN from this edition and the importance of be an Ambassador the some ideas that i think about the Ambassador Role. 

Then begin our first Fellowship Session:
The first speakers are Tijani Ben Jemaa and Maureen Hilyard both from ALAC(At-Large Advisory Committee). They explain to us the big efforts present in ALAC to create e develop leaderships thru mentoring programs. They also make a great an explanation about the At Large Structures and the regions AROs. 

			
After the ALAC round of question, Sherwood Moore make a great introduction about the Reviews of ICANN, basically the ICANN Reviews are a way to secure one of the main purpose of ICANN: A single interoperable Internet supported by stable, secure and resilient unique identifiers. The reviews are a way of community make sure that the organization flows, initiative and changes are scoped with the main purpose. The review are separate by Organization Review and Specific Reviews. A good idea to help in the selection of Reviewers would be to use platforms as ICANNLearn and ICANNWiki to help make the selection based on what types of contribution the proposed reviewer already give to community.

Then came the RSSAC representative Carlos Reyes to explain the works from RSAC (Root Server Advirosy Commitee), this AC is quite close, the only to participate is applying to RSSAC Caucus that is a technicall body of experts from different backgrounds. The RSAC is the AC responsible to keep the 13 root servers are operated by 12 independent organizations (Verisigh has two instances). Everyone can check the addrress of each server by accessing the hints file( can bbe found here https://www.internic.net/zones/named.root)

Subsequently Patrik F√§lstr√∂n explain to Fellows the SSAC (Security and Stability Advisory Commitee) works and functions. The SSAC is composed by 32 members and every member has to sign a NDA (non-disclosure agreement), there is a working group just to select new members. This is the group that i  see myself howerver the skill level and background work from member encourages me to achieve more experience. But it is good to have this as compass to orient myself in trouble times or even in anxiety moments.

As Fellowship  session ends the "High Interest Topics  session: Mitigation of Abuse in gTLDs" starts showing the different approaches that are taken by the DNS industry.

The LAC Space always seek to invite people from where the region where the ICANN meetings is been held to open the session, this time was India showing their IoT (Internet of Things) initiatives to give access and improve the life of indian people.

La Parra gave space to talk about the Governance Prime, a youth lead and youth driven initiative that some Nextgen@ICANN53 members are executing in they regions.Was presented a study about the domain name industry in Latim America, the study was conducted by someone outside of region (maybe to be more neutral). For least was presented to community the CEILAC a entrepreneurship center focused on domain names.

The last session from my day was the Open Mic the place that community talks directly with board members, for this session i think that after the two minutes warning they should play a bell song for each five seconds that the OpenMic speakers keep talking, because his is stealing time from the community .

### Day #4


Again, day started with a revision agenda meeting with my coach Renata. During the morning i attended to GAC session on Trademark Clearing House and the presentation about Digital India project. The government of India are making huge investment in this area, they are trying to facilitate the interaction between government and citizen offering digital facilities. An interesting thing was the promotion of epayments to decrease the black money operations. The India government is also offering a eSigh program that offer the possibility to have a digital signature for 0.2 USD (United States Dollar) and to have a national biometric database. This things are only possible when you have investment in Infrastructure, goverment and services. Another great step to insert all this things is the possibility to offer OpenData, this item is to democracy today what the √Ågora was to the Greek in the dawn of democracy.

The GAC sessions are quite complex, due the amount of members, and they always need a consensus. The GAC members should study and develop community skills, because, as we know based on related works of UN and other community country initiatives, the decision makers are the same in the different institutions.

During our Fellowship Session we have the fabulous presentation of Richard Lamb about abuse on the internet, he used the same slide that he use to do train with Law enforcement i really enjoy the training and take notes to try to do something like these in my community. He introduces terms like DGA (domain generation algorithins) and Busines Email Compromise.

Then Olga Cavali explained to the fellows what is the GAC, the recent history of GAC and how it works. The discussion of sovereignty and domain was very interesting, the same with Community and language (internationalized domain names).

G√∂ran Marby the CEO of ICANN, gave to the fellow a quick but sparkling talk. Talking about the importance of Internet and how to keep the internet open, universal and resilient. If this did not happen then the internet maybe will could not give to poor people what rich people always had - the information.

Then came Hans Petter Holen and Zahid Jamil from the NOMCOM (Nomination Commitee) that is responsible to choose the Chair positions and half of the board.

After the fellowship session i attended to RSAC open meeting and to RSAC Caucus meetings. Both meeting are interesting they just introduce the RSAC work to community explaining what they do and what they don't.

The afternoon fellowship session was a talk about IANA transition with Chris Mondini, about what ICANN movements during the IANA Transition. We can see here a amazing model of multistakeholder organization that maybe, can be exported to different initiatives.

Afterwards Chris, Elizabeth Andrews talks about the ICANN Learn, an Online Learning Platform that offers courses from different areas, it is a great tool to introduction, but in my opinion could be more used with if has integrations with community (i.e. the use of this platform could be a differential in NextGen selection criteria, because the academic will show interest in engage with this ecosystem).




### Day #5

On the fellowship of this day we have the opportunity to talk Christopher Wilson the Chair of Busines Constituency that brings us two fellows as Constituency members Lawrence Olawale-Roberts and Chaitanya Ramachandran ( in my opinion this was wise, to invite fellows  allumni to show to the current felllows about the great empowerment that the fellowship program supplies). This constituency represents Business that rely on internet and want some representation in Internet Governance. It would be great if this constituency offer opportunities to Startups or Startups clusters to join the discussion and get in the internet governance field. 

The next speaker was Tapani Tarvainen from NCSG (Non Commercial Stakeholder Group), this Stakeholder groups defends the end users, the content from this SG are create by end users and related organizations (i.e. Organization that defends the End Users)

The NPOC (Not for profit Organization Constituency) was represented by Klaus Stoll. This constituency represents and get together organization that don't seek for profit in Internet. I like the example given by Klaus Stoll "The internet is a country where 99.99%" of population did not know that there is a governance.

The next community leader was Rafik Dammak from NCUC (Non Commercial users constituency) this constituency act on  themes like Freedon of Speech, privacy and Human Rights just on DNS (Domain name system) scope.

Katrina Sataki represented the ccNSO (country code name support organization) to be part of this constituency you must be a CCTLD(Countrycode Top level domain)

### Day #6
On this fellowship session we have the presence of Anthony Holmes the vice chair of ISP (Internet Service Provider) Constituency he explain to us the activities from the constituency and the huge improvements needed to the new GTLD (Generic Top Level domain) was a cooperation between the Universal acceptance Steering Group and the ISPs. Lot of outreach was needed to make this.

In the afternoon session we received the visit of Louie Lee chair from Address Supporting Organization that explained the relation between this SO and the Regional Internet Registries. During this talk i discover that exist in some region a wanting list to use IP Blocks.

THe last talk of the day was Greg Shatan chair from IPC (Intelectual Property Constituency) the members of this constituency are those actor with interest in intellectual property, this only covers issues related domain name, and there is a strong connection with the WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization). This constituency leads to a great discussion around freedom of expression and speech versus content

### Day 7
On the last day of the meeting i've had the opportunity to talk directly with Patrick Falstron the Chair and the vice chair James Galvin. We talked about the  path to become a SSAC member, as long that all member have a high level of skill and ability, i asked if there are plans to SSAC create a onboarding program, unfortunately Patrik told me that they are not plan to do something like that.

## Foellow Up

This is what I'll follow after my first participation in the fellowship program, i divided my follow-up in 4 milestones. Below you can find a description/explanation of how i intend to achieve each one. I believe that explaining this transparency is also an invite, if some of this follow-up make sense for you and you think that can contribute feel free to get in touch i create a personal schedule for each one of these and will be happy to share.

### SSAC explained
After talk with Patrik F√§lstr√∂n, i was inspired to create relevant content to community based on SSAC Works. To achieve this i plan to create a content SSAC Explaned (after check if i can use this name in this kind of work). After reading the SSAC works and the context of this works i intend to create a content that will explain why the community request the advise and seek to understand why SSAC decided this. This content fills my purpose to create technical outreach, contribution to community and transit between different layers of technical skill explaining complex subject to a broader group.

### Join the NCUC
I already asked to join the NCUC, i think that i can contribute as a individual professional joining in this constituency. My milestone is to follow the work of this constituency and improve the onboarding program.

### Governance Prime
After my participation as a Fellow, i understand even more the importance and the contribution on training, onboarding and outreach that the Governance Prime has. My milestone in this subject is to develop a way that the Governance Prime works in universities (so we can create more edition with the partnership with this stakeholder group)  

### IcannWikiPtbr
One of the milestone is to produce Brazilian Portuguese content in ICANNWiki, to achieve this milestone cooperation is needed, the path to reach this cooperation is by inviting all stakeholders and institutions that acts in the ICANN ecosystem to colaborate creating their pages. Next, i'll invite the Governance Prime students to create content that they think lacking. Next will try to organize some ICANNWiki hackatons to introduce the platform and the content in a more abroad way.

### Expanding the community
My last milestone is the tougher, my milestone is to expand the community as a whole, i intend to do this by explaining the ICANN's work and inviting more 10 people to enter and participate in the some Constituency, Advisory committee, support Organization or join some Review Team.
